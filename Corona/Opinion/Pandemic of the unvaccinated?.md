# Is this a pandemic of the unvaccinated?

According to popular belief, the sources of infections are primarily the unvaccinated. Even governments and mainstream media are sharing and propagating this opinion as if it was a scientific fact with no serious debate about it. It's being portraied as if only fringe opinions and pseudoscience refute to accept this truth.

In this article I'd like to demonstrate that the entire discussion around covid-19 and the vaccines against it is dogmatic and discussions with friends and relatives often revolve around debunked claims, false models or simply unbased statements from politicians.

## Efficacy of vaccines

When BionTech's/Pfizer's vaccine had been given emergency approval, its efficacy was advertised with 95%. Although we've learned that immunity from vaccines wanes rather quickly, at the time the first vaccines were rolled out, the efficacy of 95% was correct. One important aspect has not been addressed whatsoever in most media: **The difference between relative efficacy and absolute efficacy.**

### Real-world example calculations

The following text can be summarized in a few points:
* "The absolute risk of the children developing tetanus is calculated from the number of cases divided by the size of the group."
* "The relative risk is calculated by dividing the absolute risk of the vaccinated group by the absolute risk of the control group."
* "the relative risk reduction is only partially related to the absolute risk reduction"

The article ["On the efficacy of influenza and COVID-19 vaccines"](https://multipolar-magazin.de/artikel/efficacy-of-vaccines) explains the difference quite well:

> ### Evaluation of randomized controlled studies using the example of a tetanus vaccination
> 
> [...] In the double-blind study, the participating women were vaccinated against either tetanus or influenza. After their newborns had seen the light of day, the researchers registered how many children developed tetanus or died from it shortly after birth. Based on this data, the absolute and relative risk reduction is determined as follows.
> 
> In the group of mothers who had received the tetanus vaccine at least twice, nine out of 565 newborns developed tetanus, while in the control group, where the mothers had received the flu shot, 49 out of 617 newborns contracted tetanus. **The absolute risk of the children developing tetanus is calculated from the number of cases divided by the size of the group.** In the tetanus vaccine group the equation 9 / 565 equals 0.016 or 1.6 percent and in the control group 49 / 617 equals 0.079 or 7.9 percent.
> [...]
> **The relative risk is calculated by dividing the absolute risk of the vaccinated group by the absolute risk of the control group.** The equation 1.6 percent / 7.9 percent equals to 0.201 or 20.1 percent.
> 
> ![Table of relative and absolute risk reduction and effectiveness|600](https://multipolar-magazin.de/media/pages/artikel/efficacy-of-vaccines/cdc5233265-1629432965/tab1.jpg)
> **Table 2:** Absolute and relative risk reduction of neonatal mortality from tetanus related to vaccinated and non-vaccinated mothers, data source: [Cochrane Library](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD002959.pub4/full)
> [...]
> [It] is important to understand that **the relative risk reduction is only partially related to the absolute risk reduction**. If, in the example above, the absolute risk reduction in the vaccinated as well as in the control group had been ten times smaller, i.e. 0.16 percent and 0.79 percent instead of 1.6 and 7.9 percent, the absolute risk reduction would only have been 0.63 percent and [...] the relative risk reduction of almost 80 percent would have remained the same.

The key take-aways are:
* The absolute efficacy take the size of the groups into account
* The relative efficacy only compares the absolute risk of the vaccinated group with the control group

That means that the relative efficacy has no meaning without the absolute effectiveness, especially when considering how many people have to get vaccinated to prevent a case (not death!).

### Covid-19 data

The study, which had been conducted by Pfizer and [published](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577?query=RP) in the New England Journal of Medicine on December 10, 2020, showed an efficacy of 95 percent. 40.000 participants were divided into two more or less equally large groups, of which one got the real vaccine while the other one had been given a placebo.

> **Table 3:** Absolute and relative risk reduction of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases after two vaccinations with the COVID-19 vaccine from Biontech, data source: [The New England Journal of Medicine](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577?query=RP)
> ...
> Table 3 shows how low the risk of being tested positive for COVID-19, even without vaccination, actually is compared to the risk of an infection with other pathogens such as tetanus. The absolute risk reduction of 0.71 percent is correspondingly low and the minimum number of people to vaccinate so that one laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 case occurs less is therefore very high. The relative risk reduction of 95 percent may seem high, but almost twice as many people have to be vaccinated compared to influenza vaccinations for one case to occur less.

The absolute risk reduction is 0.79%. This number doesn't sound as good as 95% though, so it's understandable that it wasn't being advertised if the perspective was that only vaccines can help us to get through the pandemic safely, which - coming back to my point in the intro text - is rather a dogmatic approach than a scientific one.

## Covid-19 symptoms induces by the vaccines

One could argue that taking a vaccine would still make sense at this point. Albeit not being perfect, it still reduces the risk of getting sick. The article I've quoted from above has another very interesting point though:

> However, what the internationally distributed press reports on the efficacy of the Biontech vaccine as well as the assessment of the CDC omit is additional data from the phase III study by Biontech / Pfizer, which was [published](https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download) by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This data, which can be found in a short paragraph on page 42 of the 53-page document, reflects badly on the effectiveness of the vaccination, as, among other things, it also shows the COVID-19-like symptoms without positive confirmation by a laboratory test seven days after the second dose of the vaccine.

> **Table 4:** Absolute and relative risk reduction of COVID-19-like diseases after two vaccinations with the COVID-19 vaccine from Biontech, data source: [US Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download#page=42)

The results show that the vaccine itself causes covid-like symptoms. The number of covid-like side-effects in the group that had received the actual vaccine is higher than both the amount of covid-like side-effects in the control group as well as the amount of people who had gotten covid confirmed by a labratory.

Wether the vaccine has any impact on mortality could not be determined. The article says: "*Despite the large number of participants, this clinical study as well cannot prove a reduction in mortality due to the vaccine, since no deaths related to the pathogen occurred.*"

## Intermediate conclusion

As shown above, the vaccine has a rather poor absolute efficacy while it actually induced the symptoms that it's supposed to prevent. Furthermore did the study not reveil any information about the effect on mortality as no one from both groups had died during the study.

One might still think that taking the vaccine is advisible for the following reasons, which we'll take a look at as well:

1. Vaccines reduce virus transmission
2. The vaccines are relatively safe, so benefit outweighs the risk

## Vaccines reduce virus transmission

In the meantime, since the study has been published, the science arguing for vaccines and vaccine mandates have cought up with the fact that the vaccine is not perfect. But there's still the belief that you should get vaccinated for solidarity to protect the vulnerable.

Several studies have now confirmed, that vaccinated people trasmit the disease just like unvaccinated people. The most prominent one ist from the US with the title ["*Transmission potential of vaccinated and unvaccinated persons infected with the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant in a federal prison, Julyâ€”August 2021*"](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.12.21265796v1.full). The results of that study are illuminating:

> **Results** A total of 978 specimens were provided by 95 participants, of whom 78 (82%) were fully vaccinated and 17 (18%) were not fully vaccinated. No significant differences were detected in duration of RT-PCR positivity among fully vaccinated participants (median: 13 days) versus those not fully vaccinated (median: 13 days; p=0.50), or in duration of culture positivity (medians: 5 days and 5 days; p=0.29). Among fully vaccinated participants, overall duration of culture positivity was shorter among Moderna vaccine recipients versus Pfizer (p=0.048) or Janssen (p=0.003) vaccine recipients.
> 
> **Conclusions** As this field continues to develop, clinicians and public health practitioners should consider vaccinated persons who become infected with SARS-CoV-2 to be no less infectious than unvaccinated persons. These findings are critically important, especially in congregate settings where viral transmission can lead to large outbreaks.

[An article](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)02243-1/fulltext#), published in the lancet, highlights some numbers present in the US which indicate that vaccinated people are just as transmissive as the non-vaccinated:

> In Massachusetts, USA, a total of 469 new COVID-19 cases were detected during various events in July, 2021, and 346 (74%) of these cases were in people who were fully or partly vaccinated, 274 (79%) of whom were symptomatic. Cycle threshold values were similarly low between people who were fully vaccinated (median 22Â·8) and people who were unvaccinated, not fully vaccinated, or whose vaccination status was unknown (median 21Â·5), indicating a high viral load even among people who were fully vaccinated [2](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)02243-1/fulltext#bib2).

[Another study](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3897733) which checked the transmission of the Covid-19 delta variant among vaccinated health care workers in Vietnam, found out, that the health care workers that caught a new strain of the delta variant had a 251 times higher viral load compared to people with an older strain. They conclude that the new strain must've been transmitted between the health care workers and guess, that the extremely high viral load could be the reason for transmission among the vaccinated:

> Findings: Between 11thâ€“25th June 2021 (week 7â€“8 after dose 2), 69 healthcare workers were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. 62 participated in the clinical study. 49 were (pre)symptomatic with one requiring oxygen supplementation. All recovered uneventfully. 23 complete-genome sequences were obtained. They all belonged to the Delta variant, and were phylogenetically distinct from the contemporary Delta variant sequences obtained from community transmission cases, suggestive of ongoing transmission between the workers. Viral loads of breakthrough Delta variant infection cases were 251 times higher than those of cases infected with old strains detected between March-April 2020. Time from diagnosis to PCR negative was 8â€“33 days (median: 21). Neutralizing antibody levels after vaccination and at diagnosis of the cases were lower than those in the matched uninfected controls. There was no correlation between vaccine-induced neutralizing antibody levels and viral loads or the development of symptoms.
> Interpretation: Breakthrough Delta variant infections are associated with high viral loads, prolonged PCR positivity, and low levels of vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies, explaining the transmission between the vaccinated people.
