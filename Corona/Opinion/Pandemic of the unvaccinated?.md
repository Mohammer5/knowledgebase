# Pandemic of the unvaccinated?

According to popular belief, the sources of infections are primarily the unvaccinated. Even governments and mainstream media are sharing and propagating this opinion as if it was a scientific fact with no serious debate about it. It's being portraied as if only fringe opinions and pseudoscience refute to accept this truth.

In this article I'd like to demonstrate that the entire discussion around covid-19 - and the vaccines as a measure to stop the pandemic - is dogmatic and discussions with friends and relatives often revolve around debunked claims, false models or simply unbased statements from politicians.

The following claims have been made about the vaccines and are the central arguments of the discussions in both mainstream as well as alternative media:

The vaccines:
*  have a good efficacy
*  prevent or reduce transmittance of the virus
*  reduce the severity of an illness
*  are relatively safe, so benefits outweigh the risks

Besides focussing on the vaccines themselves, I'd also like to take a look at the arguments brought forward that build the foundation of the reasoning behind rolling out vaccination campains or even vaccine mandates for professions, which has been done by a few countries already, or entire populations like Austria.

Besides talking about the vaccines in isolation, I'll try to tackle the following points:
* reliability of covid-tests
* excess mortality
* situation in the hospitals
* the ethics of vaccine mandates

Before diving deep into the topics, I'd like to highlight the following video by Neil Oliver with the title ["Will we remain silent while a dark tide slides ever closer to our own shores?"]([https://youtu.be/GWN2PV4v0lk](https://youtu.be/GWN2PV4v0lk "Share link")) which is about the ethics of vaccine mandates.

## Efficacy of vaccines

When BionTech's/Pfizer's vaccine had been given emergency approval, its efficacy was advertised with 95%. Although we've learned that immunity from vaccines wanes rather quickly, at the time the first vaccines were rolled out, the efficacy of 95% was correct. One important aspect has not been addressed whatsoever in most media: **The difference between relative efficacy and absolute efficacy.**

Even authors of [articles published in the lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099%2821%2900075-X/fulltext) have gotten this wrong and the magazine had to correct the mistakes they've publish:

> It does not mean that 95% of people are protected from disease with the vaccine—a general misconception of vaccine protection also found in a _Lancet Infectious Diseases_ Editorial [\[4\]](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099%2821%2900075-X/fulltext#bib4).

### Real-world example calculations

The following text can be summarized in a few points:
* "The absolute risk of the children developing tetanus is calculated from the number of cases divided by the size of the group."
* "The relative risk is calculated by dividing the absolute risk of the vaccinated group by the absolute risk of the control group."
* "the relative risk reduction is only partially related to the absolute risk reduction"

The article ["On the efficacy of influenza and COVID-19 vaccines"](https://multipolar-magazin.de/artikel/efficacy-of-vaccines) explains the difference quite well:

> ### Evaluation of randomized controlled studies using the example of a tetanus vaccination
> 
> [...] In the double-blind study, the participating women were vaccinated against either tetanus or influenza. After their newborns had seen the light of day, the researchers registered how many children developed tetanus or died from it shortly after birth. Based on this data, the absolute and relative risk reduction is determined as follows.
> 
> In the group of mothers who had received the tetanus vaccine at least twice, nine out of 565 newborns developed tetanus, while in the control group, where the mothers had received the flu shot, 49 out of 617 newborns contracted tetanus. **The absolute risk of the children developing tetanus is calculated from the number of cases divided by the size of the group.** In the tetanus vaccine group the equation 9 / 565 equals 0.016 or 1.6 percent and in the control group 49 / 617 equals 0.079 or 7.9 percent.
> [...]
> **The relative risk is calculated by dividing the absolute risk of the vaccinated group by the absolute risk of the control group.** The equation 1.6 percent / 7.9 percent equals to 0.201 or 20.1 percent.
> 
> ![Table of relative and absolute risk reduction and effectiveness|600](https://multipolar-magazin.de/media/pages/artikel/efficacy-of-vaccines/cdc5233265-1629432965/tab1.jpg)
> **Table 2:** Absolute and relative risk reduction of neonatal mortality from tetanus related to vaccinated and non-vaccinated mothers, data source: [Cochrane Library](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD002959.pub4/full)
> [...]
> [It] is important to understand that **the relative risk reduction is only partially related to the absolute risk reduction**. If, in the example above, the absolute risk reduction in the vaccinated as well as in the control group had been ten times smaller, i.e. 0.16 percent and 0.79 percent instead of 1.6 and 7.9 percent, the absolute risk reduction would only have been 0.63 percent and [...] the relative risk reduction of almost 80 percent would have remained the same.

The key take-aways are:
* The absolute efficacy takes the size of the groups into account
* The relative efficacy only compares the absolute risk of the vaccinated group with the control group

That means that the relative efficacy has no meaning without the absolute effectiveness, especially when considering how many people have to get vaccinated to prevent a case (not death!).

### Covid-19 data

The study, which had been conducted by Pfizer and [published](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577?query=RP) in the New England Journal of Medicine on December 10, 2020, showed an efficacy of 95 percent. 40.000 participants were divided into two more or less equally large groups, of which one got the real vaccine while the other one had been given a placebo.

> The absolute and relative risk reductions are as follows:  
> 
> ![|600](https://multipolar-magazin.de/media/pages/artikel/efficacy-of-vaccines/6b82c13486-1629432965/tab3.jpg)
> **Table 3:** Absolute and relative risk reduction of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases after two vaccinations with the COVID-19 vaccine from Biontech, data source: [The New England Journal of Medicine](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577?query=RP)
> ...
> Table 3 shows how low the risk of being tested positive for COVID-19, even without vaccination, actually is compared to the risk of an infection with other pathogens such as tetanus. The absolute risk reduction of 0.71 percent is correspondingly low and the minimum number of people to vaccinate so that one laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 case occurs less is therefore very high. The relative risk reduction of 95 percent may seem high, but almost twice as many people have to be vaccinated compared to influenza vaccinations for one case to occur less.

The absolute risk reduction is 0.79%. This number doesn't sound as good as 95% though, so it's understandable that it wasn't being advertised if the perspective was that only vaccines can help us to get through the pandemic safely, which - coming back to my point in the intro text - is rather a dogmatic approach than a scientific one.

### Covid-19 symptoms induces by the vaccines

One could argue that taking a vaccine would still make sense at this point. Albeit not being perfect, it still reduces the risk of getting sick. The article I've quoted from above has another very interesting point though:

> However, what the internationally distributed press reports on the efficacy of the Biontech vaccine as well as the assessment of the CDC omit is additional data from the phase III study by Biontech / Pfizer, which was [published](https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download) by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This data, which can be found in a short paragraph on page 42 of the 53-page document, reflects badly on the effectiveness of the vaccination, as, among other things, it also shows the COVID-19-like symptoms without positive confirmation by a laboratory test seven days after the second dose of the vaccine.
> 
> ![|600](https://multipolar-magazin.de/media/pages/artikel/efficacy-of-vaccines/cb084cef88-1629432965/tab4.jpg)
> **Table 4:** Absolute and relative risk reduction of COVID-19-like diseases after two vaccinations with the COVID-19 vaccine from Biontech, data source: [US Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download#page=42)

The results show that the vaccine itself causes covid-like symptoms. The number of covid-like side-effects in the group that had received the actual vaccine is higher than both the amount of covid-like side-effects in the control group as well as the amount of people who had gotten covid confirmed by a labratory.

Wether the vaccine has any impact on mortality could not be determined. The article says: "*Despite the large number of participants, this clinical study as well cannot prove a reduction in mortality due to the vaccine, since no deaths related to the pathogen occurred.*"

### Intermediate conclusion

As shown above, the vaccine has a rather poor absolute efficacy while it actually induced the symptoms that it's supposed to prevent. Furthermore did the study not reveil any information about the effect on mortality as no one from both groups had died during the study.

One might still think that taking the vaccine is advisible for the following reasons, which we'll take a look at as well:

1. Vaccines reduce virus transmission
2. Vaccines reduce the severity of an illness
3. The vaccines are relatively safe, so benefit outweighs the risk

## Vaccinating is not acting in solidarity -> Vaccines do not reduce the transmission of the virus

In the meantime, since Pfizer's study has been published, the science arguing for vaccines and vaccine mandates have cought up with the fact that the vaccines do not cause a sterilizing immunity. But there's still the belief that you should get vaccinated for solidarity to protect the vulnerable.

### What is sterilizing immunity

According to Wikipedia, a "neutralizing antibody (NAb) is an antibody that defends a cell from a pathogen or infectious particle by neutralizing any effect it has biologically".
When vaccines cause the body to produce neutralizing antibodies, then that person won't transmit the pathogen to other people.

### Vaccinated people spread the virus just like the unvaccinated

Several studies have now confirmed, that vaccinated people trasmit the disease just like unvaccinated people. The most prominent one ist from the US with the title ["*Transmission potential of vaccinated and unvaccinated persons infected with the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant in a federal prison, July—August 2021*"](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.12.21265796v1.full). The results of that study are illuminating:

> **Results** A total of 978 specimens were provided by 95 participants, of whom 78 (82%) were fully vaccinated and 17 (18%) were not fully vaccinated. No significant differences were detected in duration of RT-PCR positivity among fully vaccinated participants (median: 13 days) versus those not fully vaccinated (median: 13 days; p=0.50), or in duration of culture positivity (medians: 5 days and 5 days; p=0.29). Among fully vaccinated participants, overall duration of culture positivity was shorter among Moderna vaccine recipients versus Pfizer (p=0.048) or Janssen (p=0.003) vaccine recipients.
> 
> **Conclusions** As this field continues to develop, clinicians and public health practitioners should consider vaccinated persons who become infected with SARS-CoV-2 to be no less infectious than unvaccinated persons. These findings are critically important, especially in congregate settings where viral transmission can lead to large outbreaks.

[An article](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)02243-1/fulltext#), published in the lancet, highlights some numbers present in the US which indicate that vaccinated people are just as transmissive as the non-vaccinated:

> In Massachusetts, USA, a total of 469 new COVID-19 cases were detected during various events in July, 2021, and 346 (74%) of these cases were in people who were fully or partly vaccinated, 274 (79%) of whom were symptomatic. Cycle threshold values were similarly low between people who were fully vaccinated (median 22·8) and people who were unvaccinated, not fully vaccinated, or whose vaccination status was unknown (median 21·5), indicating a high viral load even among people who were fully vaccinated [2](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)02243-1/fulltext#bib2).

[Another study](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3897733) which checked the transmission of the Covid-19 delta variant among vaccinated health care workers in Vietnam, found out, that the health care workers that caught a new strain of the delta variant had a 251 times higher viral load compared to people with an older strain. They conclude that the new strain must've been transmitted between the health care workers and guess, that the extremely high viral load could be the reason for transmission among the vaccinated:

> Findings: Between 11th–25th June 2021 (week 7–8 after dose 2), 69 healthcare workers were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. 62 participated in the clinical study. 49 were (pre)symptomatic with one requiring oxygen supplementation. All recovered uneventfully. 23 complete-genome sequences were obtained. They all belonged to the Delta variant, and were phylogenetically distinct from the contemporary Delta variant sequences obtained from community transmission cases, suggestive of ongoing transmission between the workers. **Viral loads of breakthrough Delta variant infection cases were 251 times higher than those of cases infected with old strains detected between March-April 2020**. Time from diagnosis to PCR negative was 8–33 days (median: 21). Neutralizing antibody levels after vaccination and at diagnosis of the cases were lower than those in the matched uninfected controls. There was no correlation between vaccine-induced neutralizing antibody levels and viral loads or the development of symptoms.
> Interpretation: **Breakthrough Delta variant infections are associated with high viral loads, prolonged PCR positivity, and low levels of vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies, explaining the transmission between the vaccinated people**.

### COVID-19 case notification rate in countries with high and low 

On the website https://www.corona-in-zahlen.de/ the numbers of deaths, notification rate, etc is being updated daily. The two regions with the highest vaccination rates globally, Ireland and Gibraltar, also have the higher rates of new infections per capita than many other countries with lower vaccination rate. In Germany, with a total vaccination rate of rougly 70%, the new cases per 100.000 people in 7 days is around 375 on December 14, 2021:

![[Pasted image 20211214175753.png]]

On the same day, December 14, 2021, Gibraltar has 569,9 new cases per 100.000 people in 7 days with a vaccination rate of 100%. This illustrates that vaccination alone is not the right tool to combat the pandemic as so-called breakthrough cases seem to be at least equivalent in amount with the cases in countries or regions with a lower vaccination rate.  

![[Pasted image 20211214175727.png]]

Here's a table that compares some of these values on December 14, 2021:

| Country | Notification rate per 100.000 | Vaccination rate (at least two shots) |
|-|-|-|
| Gibraltar | 569.9 | 100% |
| Ireland | 625 | 76.51% |
| Norway | 562.7 | 70.99% |
| Germany | 374.9 | 69.59% |
| Great Britain | 528.1 | 68.62% |
| Sri Lanka | 24.3 | 64.15% |
| Philippinen | 1.5 | 27.74% |

Many countries, like Philippines and Ireland can't be compared directly as there are many factors that contribute to viral transmission, especially the winter season. What is very clear though, is that the vaccination rate does not seem to have a significant impact on the development of new cases, it's certainly a very strong indication supporting the argument that vaccination is not an act of solidarity.

### Vaccines supposedly reduce the amount of people with the need for an ICU

Another argument made quite often is that taking the vaccine will reduce the amount of beds used in hospitals and unvaccinated people suppsedly take away the beds of other people.

The DIVI, which has been recording the free and occupied treatment capacities in intensive care medicine in Germany, shows the following two graphics:

![[Pasted image 20211215110025.png]]
*Number of reported COVID-19 cases treated in intensive care*

![[Pasted image 20211215105544.png]]
*Total number of reported intensive care beds (operable beds and emergency reserve)*

One observable fact is that there's no significant impact of the number of Covid-19 cases treated in intensive care on the amount of occupied beds in intensive care over the course of the entire pandemic. This is is not due to a shortage of available beds. The Bundesrechnungshof, which ist the , has stated in an internal report, that since November 2020, hospitals in Germany have an incentive to report less available beds as they will only receive Covid-19 related funding if at least 75% of their beds are occupied (see [here](https://www.zdf.de/nachrichten/politik/corona-bundesrechnungshof-spahn-verschwendung-100.html) or [here](https://www.hna.de/politik/corona-kliniken-intensivbetten-bundesrechnungshof-bericht-manipulation-jens-spahn-zr-90797388.html) or [here](https://www.corodok.de/bundesregierung-zahl-intensivbetten/)).

---

Another relevant [study](https://idw-online.de/de/news771029) has been done by the University of Duisburg/Essen. They took the currently still valid assumption, that "\[i]f the Ct value of those who tested positive is 25 or higher, it is currently assumed that they are no longer contagious because the viral load is too low." With that in mind, they found out that "\[o]n average, around 60 percent of those tested with COVID-19 symptoms were found to have such high CT values. In weeks 10 to 19 it was even 78 percent who were very probably no longer contagious".

A commonly made argument is that the study did not know whether the test was done before or after the time of the high of the viral load. As that's an unknown, taking only half of the result into account, that still leaves 30% which is high enough to bring doubt into the numbers used officially.

### Intermediate conclusion

*  The vaccines have a poor absolute efficacy
*  They induce the symptoms that they're supposed to prevent
*  Vaccines to not prevent the vaccinated from transmitting the virus, they're therefore not a means of protecting others

This leaves the following two points up for discussion:

1. Vaccines reduce the severity of an illness
2. The vaccines are relatively safe, so benefit outweighs the risk

## Vaccines only partially reduce the risk of severe illness

It appears that vaccines to have an impact on the severity of the illness and reduce the total number of people that have a severe course of illness or die. The RKI, which is Germany's verion of the USA's CDC releases new reports every week which summarizes the data of the past weeks. In the latest one to this point ("[Wöchentlicher COVID-19-Lagebericht vom 09.12.2021](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Situationsberichte/Wochenbericht/Wochenbericht_2021-12-09.pdf?__blob=publicationFile)"), the following table can be found on page 23:

![[Pasted image 20211215090512.png]]

The English translation is as follows:

![[Pasted image 20211215092407.png]]

I've used those numbers and created the total percantage of break-through cases. Of course it's debatable what these numbers actually say. But I think they illustrate quite clearly that the break-through cases are but the norm:

![[Pasted image 20211215102911.png]]

The figures that are most relevant - at least in my view - are the numbers of deaths. Most deaths occur in the age group of 60+ years: 92.63% (`1447 / (1 + 114 + 1447)`). In this age group 45.6% have been vaccinated.

---

Another interesting factor is that the biggest state in Germany, Bavaria, counts people with unknown vaccination status as unvaccinated:

> The LGL press office answered an inquiry as to how many corona cases without a clear vaccination status were assigned to the unvaccinated incidence as follows: The vaccination status of 57,489 corona cases was unclear. A total of 72,141 cases were assigned to the incidence of unvaccinated persons. That would mean: Well over two-thirds of the seven-day incidence among unvaccinated people were people whose vaccination status had not yet been clarified at this point in time.
> (Original in German: Eine Anfrage, wie viele Corona-Fälle ohne klaren Impfstatus der Ungeimpften-Inzidenz zugerechnet wurden, beantwortet die Pressestelle des LGL wie folgt: Bei 57.489 Corona-Fällen war der Impfstatus unklar. Insgesamt seien 72.141 Fälle der Ungeimpften-Inzidenz zugerechnet worden. Das würde heißen: Deutlich mehr als zwei Drittel der Sieben-Tage-Inzidenz unter Ungeimpften machten Personen aus, deren Impfstatus zu diesem Zeitpunkt noch nicht geklärt war.)
> ([Source](https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/news/verzerrung-der-statistik-bayern-zaehlt-unbekannten-impfstatus-als-ungeimpft-li.199206))

The reasoning for doing so is, that it turned out later that "these - according to later available data - were unvaccinated in the vast majority of cases." Unfortunately there's no way of checking this claim. Another question that I have about this is: How could they possibly know the indications of data that wasn't available at the time?

Another aspect is how accurate this data actually is. The RKI gets its data about the sitation in the hospitals from the DIVI. In the [regulation details](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/diviintregv/DIVIIntRegV.pdf) about reporting cases, it says the following:

> (3) The hospitals transmit the number of patients and without providing any personal data Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who:
> 1. are treated in intensive care, differentiated
>    * according to age groups to be determined by the Robert Koch Institute and differentiated according to Adults and children,
>    * after pregnant women
>    * if known, according to SARS-CoV-2 virus variants
>    * after previous COVID-19 vaccinations,
> 2. be invasively ventilated or
> 3. have been newly admitted and have been out of intensive medical treatment of the
Hospital were discharged.
>
> (German original: (3) Die Krankenhäuser übermitteln ohne Angabe von personenbezogenen Daten die Anzahl der Patientinnen und Patienten mit einer SARS-CoV-2-Infektion, die:
> 1.   intensivmedizinisch behandelt werden, differenziert
>    * nach vom Robert Koch-Institut festzulegenden Altersgruppen und dabei differenziert nach Erwachsenen und Kindern
>    * nach Schwangeren
>    * wenn bekannt, nach SARS-CoV-2-Virusvarianten
>    * nach bislang erfolgten COVID-19-Schutzimpfungen
> 2.   invasiv beatmet werden oder
> 3.   neu aufgenommen wurden und seit dem 1. Januar 2020 aus der intensivmedizinischen Behandlung des Krankenhauses entlassen wurden.)

These regulations do not differentiate between patients who were admitted due to Covid-19 or for other reasons. Effectively the numbers display how many people with a positive test result are in the hospitals, not how many people are in the hospitals because of Covid-19. Due to this fact, these numbers are unusable as they do not have a scientific value and can't be used to judge the situation that occurs due to Covid-19.

According to [an article](https://multipolar-magazin.de/artikel/pandemie-der-ungeimpften) published on multipolar-magazin.de, the data what "symptomatic" means is very ambigous as well:

> The information about the symptoms and vaccination status of a case comes from the reports from doctors' practices and hospitals to the respective health department. According to [Section 6 of](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/ifsg/__6.html) the Infection Protection Act, suspected illness, illness and death in relation to COVID-19 must be reported by the attending physician to the respective health department. However, the forms for the registration forms differ from state to state. In addition to information on the vaccination status, any symptoms are queried. But it is precisely in this respect that the reporting forms differ considerably ... This makes a nationwide detailed evaluation of the symptoms impossible. This explains why the RKI can only differentiate between cases **with** and **without** symptoms. “With symptoms” can therefore mean that a patient has to be ventilated invasively or only complains of a sore throat or loss of taste. With these data, it is not possible to systematically evaluate the burden on the German health system due to an illness
> 
> (German original: Die Informationen über Symptomatik und Impfstatus eines Falles stammen aus den Meldungen der Arztpraxen und Krankenhäuser an das jeweilige Gesundheitsamt. Gemäß [Paragraf 6](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/ifsg/__6.html) des Infektionsschutzgesetzes ist der Verdacht einer Erkrankung, die Erkrankung sowie der Tod in Bezug auf COVID-19 vom behandelnden Arzt an das jeweilige Gesundheitsamt zu melden. Die Vordrucke der Meldebögen sind jedoch von Bundesland zu Bundesland verschieden. Neben Angaben zum Impfstatus werden auch etwaige Symptome abgefragt. Doch ausgerechnet in dieser Hinsicht unterscheiden sich die Meldebögen erheblich ... Eine bundesweite detaillierte Auswertung der Symptome wird dadurch unmöglich gemacht. Das erklärt, warum das RKI Fälle nur **mit** und **ohne** Symptomatik unterscheiden kann. „Mit Symptomatik“ kann demnach bedeuten, dass ein Patient invasiv beatmet werden muss oder lediglich nur über Halsschmerzen oder Geschmacksverlust klagt. Mit diesen Daten kann die Belastung des deutschen Gesundheitssystems aufgrund einer Krankheit, die in den meisten Fällen harmlos oder mild verläuft, nicht systematisch ausgewertet werden.)

---

In another series of two articles ([article one](https://multipolar-magazin.de/artikel/abrechnungsdaten-krankenkassen), [article two](https://multipolar-magazin.de/artikel/gruende-fuer-impfpflicht-fehlen)), the same magazine (multipolar-magazin.de) has analyzed the billing data of the health insurance companies. Their conclusion is, that "\[o]nly every second "Corona patient" is in the hospital due to a suspected Corona".

They also took a look at the hospitalized cases in general as well as the hospitalized cases on the ICU for all reasons. The following two graphics, created by the Institut für das Entgeltsystem im Krankenhaus ("Institute for the remuneration system in hospitals"), show that Covid-19 has a very low impact on the situation in the hospitals and the ICU specifically:

**Hospitalized cases**
![[Pasted image 20211215131708.png]]
* red = Covid-19 cases with acute lower respiratory diseases
* dark blue = All acute lower respiratory diseases
* light blue = all stationary admittances

**Hospitalized cases on the ICU**
![[Pasted image 20211215131750.png]]
* red = Covid-19 cases with acute lower respiratory diseases
* dark blue = All acute lower respiratory diseases
* light blue = all stationary admittances

With these findings, the magazine raises the following question:

> In view of the record low occupancy rates in German hospitals since the beginning of the corona crisis, **the question arises not only whether people who are not vaccinated against COVID-19 pose a threat to the German health system, but whether the pandemic will affect hospitals in this country at all if no action is taken would have posed a serious problem.**
> 
> (German original: Angesichts des Rekordtiefs der Auslastung der deutschen Krankenhäuser seit Beginn der Coronakrise stellt sich nicht nur die Frage, ob Menschen, die sich nicht gegen COVID-19 impfen lassen, eine Gefahr für das deutsche Gesundheitssystem darstellen, sondern ob die Pandemie ohne Maßnahmen die Krankenhäuser hierzulande überhaupt vor ein ernsthaftes Problem gestellt hätte.)

This further highlights the difficulties to make accurate statements about the situation that's been caused due to Covid-19 based on the data the RKI and DIVI publish.

### Intermediate conclusion

Vaccines seem to reduce the amount of hospitalizations, the need to put the patient on the ICU or deaths in general. Another thought that has be made is that the ratio of vaccinated/unvaccinated leans more and more into the direction of the vaccinated the higher the vaccination rate is, as the amount of unvaccinated people becomes more or less insignificant at some point. But the numbers do illustrate that the vaccines do not prevent severe illnesses or deaths, they simply reduce the numbers.

*  The vaccines have a poor absolute efficacy
*  They induce the symptoms that they're supposed to prevent
*  Vaccines to not prevent the vaccinated from transmitting the virus, they're therefore not a means of protecting others
*  Vaccines reduce the chance of a severe illness or death, but do not necessarily prevent these. Amount of break-through cases als raises doubt as to how effective the vaccines really are.
	*  We have no idea who's in the ICU because of Covid-19 or for another reason, for example post-surgery surveillance
	*  We have no data on what "symptomatic" means as forms for reporting data varies from state to state within Germany

This leaves the following two points up for discussion:

2. The vaccines are relatively safe, so benefit outweighs the risk

## Vaccine safety
The safety profile for vaccines are based on two factors: The observable side-effects of the global vaccination campaign as well as the original studies done by the pharma companies. The [recent revelations](https://www.bmj.com/content/375/bmj.n2635) of a whisteblower indicate that the safety profile based on the studies by the pharmaceutical companies can't be trusted.

> A regional director who was employed at the research organisation Ventavia Research Group has told _The BMJ_ that the company falsified data, unblinded patients, employed inadequately trained vaccinators, and was slow to follow up on adverse events reported in Pfizer’s pivotal phase III trial. Staff who conducted quality control checks were overwhelmed by the volume of problems they were finding. After repeatedly notifying Ventavia of these problems, the regional director, Brook Jackson, emailed a complaint to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Ventavia fired her later the same day. Jackson has provided _The BMJ_ with dozens of internal company documents, photos, audio recordings, and emails.

Prior to these revelations, pharmaceutical companies have a long history of covering up side-effects, downplaying side-effects, etc, which further strengthens the argument for questioning the results of studies done by pharmaceutical companies in general.

### Underreporting of side-effects

There are numerous reason for why side-effects are not being reported, I'll try to highlight some that seem to have a bigger impact.

One important factor is the time it takes to report side-effects. Reports to the Paul-Ehrlich-Institut in Germany have to be files by doctors. Dama Samson reports her discussion with her general practicioner and repeats what he told her:

> English translation (original follows):
> Five to ten patients come to him every day with side effects or at least with suspected side effects caused by the corona vaccinations. Among them was a young patient whom he had to take care of as an emergency while I was waiting in the consultation room. In theory, he could and should report any suspicions to the Paul Ehrlich Institute. But that's where the first difficulty begins: each report, he says, takes about 30 minutes. So my doctor would be burdened with an additional 2.5 hours a day for five people with side effects.
> 
> German original:
> Fünf bis zehn Patienten kommen täglich zu ihm mit Nebenwirkungen oder zumindest mit dem Verdacht auf Nebenwirkungen, verursacht durch die Corona-Impfungen. Unter ihnen eine junge Patientin, um die er sich als Notfall kümmern musste, als ich noch im Sprechstundenzimmer wartete. Theoretisch könnte und sollte er jeden Verdacht dem Paul-Ehrlich-Institut melden. Da beginnt jedoch die erste Schwierigkeit: Jeder Bericht, sagt er, dauert ca. 30 Minuten. Mein Arzt wäre also bei fünf Menschen mit Nebenwirkungen täglich 2,5 Stunden zusätzlich belastet.

According to [a study](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/160/7/642/136637) about "Myopericarditis following Smallpox Vaccination", the amount of side-effects was higher by a factor of 7.5 (750%) than reported.

[Another study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4368609/pdf/pone.0118283.pdf) with the title "A Prospective Study of the Incidence of Myocarditis/Pericarditis and New Onset Cardiac Symptoms following Smallpox and Influenza Vaccination" also investigated the potential number of unreported side-effects in passive surveillance (meaning: No active surveillance of people who had been administered the vaccine and observe the vaccine's effects). Their results are stunning, they found "a more than 200-times higher [rate]". They conclude, that "[p]assive surveillance significantly underestimates the true incidence of myocarditis/pericarditis after smallpox immunization".

### Potential side-effects
In this section I would like to highlight the potential side-effects the vaccines can have. Not all of them have been recognized officially yet, but the amount of recognized side-effects is slowely increasing.

In Germany the Paul-Ehrlich Institut released a "Rote-Hand Brief" (red-hand letter) for all of the vaccines, which contain information about potential side-effects for each vaccine individually. These can be found [here](https://www.pei.de/DE/newsroom/dossier/coronavirus/coronavirus-inhalt.html?nn=169730&cms_pos=2).

The vaers reporting system of the US outlines a lot of potential side effect, I'll only cover some of them. Among the ones that I won't address is the following non-exhaustive list: Menstrual disorders, miscarriages, birth defects, severe skin reactions, eye disorders and blindness, facial paralysis, shingles and other virus reactivations, Tinnitus, hearing loss, dizziness, vertigo, anaphylactic shocks, neuro-inflammatory diseases like multiple sclerosis, PIMS,

#### Antibody-dependent enhancement

Before we start with observed side effects, I'd like to talk about an argument that's being made quite often: Long-term side-effects induced by vaccines are supposedly recognizable right away. A [long-term multi-phased study](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)32156-5/fulltext) for a new vaccine against HIV found out that men are more susceptible to HIV in the first 18 months after receiving the vaccine. What happened to these man is described with the term "ADE" (antibody dependent enhancement). When this occurs, the new antibodies aid the virus replication instead of preventing it, causing a higher viral load and therefore a higher susceptibility.

We do not have enough data to know whether this is happening or not, but there are some indications that it might be happening, like the [251-times increased viral load](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3897733) when being infected with a new strain compared to vaccinated people that got sick with an old strain.

Although the effect could be observed right away, in many cases these long-term effects are impossible to see right after administering the vaccines as these effects could depend on a virus that has mutated al least several times.

#### Heart issues

The incidence for heart issues for young people is higher than most people think. [One study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.30.21262866v1) figured out that 162.2 people of one millionen get Myocarditis. One divided by incidences per million results in a number that can be read as "one out of X". In this case for 12 to 17 year olds, that would be: `1 / (162.2 / 1000000)` which is 6165. So 1 out of ~ 6000 teenagers would get a Myocarditis.

[A report](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/06/israel-detects-link-between-myocarditis-and-covid-vaccine.html) from Isreal suggests, that "over 110 cases of myocarditis around the time of vaccination \[were found], 95 of which occurred following the second of Pfizer’s two-dose regimen. This translates to a rate of roughly one in 50,000. However, most of the people who developed the heart condition were young men, with a particularly high incidence for those aged 16 to 24, putting their rate at around one in 5,000"

In October, 2021, ["Iceland halt\[ed] Moderna jabs over heart-inflammation fears"](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-10-iceland-halts-moderna-jabs-heart-inflammation.html) and ["Taiwan halt\[ed] 2nd-dose BioNTech vaccinations for ages 12-17 amid concerns of myocarditis"](https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4340862).

#### Blood clot & related effects

Blood clots can result in all kinds of events. Heart attacks, strokes, embolism, thrombosis, and more. The most known cases happened after admission of AstraZeneca, which was highlighted by many studies (e.g. [this one](# Thrombocytopenia after COVID-19 vaccination)). The adenovirus based vaccines have been banned in some countries already while other countries suspended the use for non-senior citizens.

@TODO: Add studies that show that this can happen with other vaccines as well as the actual issue is not the vaccine itself but the spike protein which is highly toxic as it causes the body to attack its own veins.

#### Cancer

The vaccines themselves do not seem to cause cancer, at least to date there are no indications for that. But it appears that vaccines can induce a temporary immune suppression or immune dysregulation (lymphocytopenia) as [this study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8379763/) highlights. [Another study](https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR334978) found out that the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine "reprograms both adaptive and innate immune responses". Immune suppressions do play a role in cancer development, as [this study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcp.30166) suggests.

#### Change of adaptive and innate immune system

[This study](https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR334978), which I already mentioned in the "Cancer" section, discovered, that the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine "reprograms both adaptive and innate immune responses". Whether the effects are severe or not cannot be stated at this point. We also don't know whether this will be a temporary or life-long effect.

Although this is an anecdotal proof and therefore cannot be taken seriously from a scientific perspective, I can see that most of my vaccinated friends and family have been self-reportedly more sick in the past 4 months than in the past four years. They seem to have more severe colds, the cold seems to stay longer and they get multiple colds withing a couple of weeks.

### Waning immunity

Before the vaccines were available, the media and governments put all their hope into the vaccines and communicated that by vaccinating everyone, we'll end this pandemic. By that time, there was no talk about booster shots or "vaccine subscriptions", which they're talking about in Israel now. The CEO of Pfizer [said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/08/omicron-pfizer-ceo-says-we-may-need-fourth-covid-vaccine-doses-sooner-than-expected.html?utm_term=Autofeed&utm_medium=Social&utm_content=Main&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1638983340) that we may need a fourth shot and Israel [is already planning](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9959811/Israel-planning-administer-FOURTH-Covid-vaccine-adjusted-fight-new-variants.html) to administer the fourth shot. The vaccines are less perfect than everyone hoped initially and break-through cases are getting more and more, as demonstrated earlier in this article.

### Intermediate conclusion

The amount of side-effects is currently unknown. Many studies have shown that underreporting has to be expressed in factors, not percentages. Only studies that closely followed patients who had been given a viccine were able to produce high quality numbers like the chance that 1 out of ~5000 teenagers will get a Myocarditis (could be mild, could be severe) from the vaccine.

Considering that Covid-19 is only really dangerous to people with co-morbidities as well as the elderly as well as that the vaccines do have an unusually high side-effect profile, it's safe to say that the conclusion for whether the benefits outweigh the risks has to be a personal choice.

The chance of experiencing a side-effect is still relatively low, but way higher than with other vaccines or other therapies. So depending on the age, especially for children and teenagers, it's relatively safe to say that the risks outweigh the benifits.

*  The vaccines have a poor absolute efficacy
*  They induce the symptoms that they're supposed to prevent
*  Vaccines to not prevent the vaccinated from transmitting the virus, they're therefore not a means of protecting others
*  Vaccines reduce the chance of a severe illness or death, but do not necessarily prevent these. Amount of break-through cases als raises doubt as to how effective the vaccines really are.
	*  We have no idea who's in the ICU because of Covid-19 or for another reason, for example post-surgery surveillance
	*  We have no data on what "symptomatic" means as forms for reporting data varies from state to state within Germany
*  Whether the benefits outweigh the risks depends heavily on whether a person is old or has co-morbidities. This cannot be generalized and therefore has to be an individual decision
