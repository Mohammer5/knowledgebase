# Precision Stone Fitting

In the Serapeum we can see that a liquid was used to polish stone. Modern science knows that acid reacts with stones made from organic materials, like sandstone.

If the ancients had some knowledge of chemistry that we do not have yet and could apply it to smoothing stones, they probably could use it to meld two stones together, adding the last percentages of precision required for perfect fitting.
